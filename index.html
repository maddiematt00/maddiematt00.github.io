            I love to write! In my freetime, I like to free write poems and short stories and watch black and white movies. I love Suspense and my favorite director is Alfred Hitchcock. When not watching movies, writing, or reading books, I love to teach the children at my church in Children's Church. At my church, I am a member of the Mass Choir, Usher Board, Public Relations Team, and the Food Bank Ministry.
